# Flask-MongoDB Web App

This app is an interactive, malleable soccer database. It features many of the world's best teams, situated largely in Europe, with men's and women's teams. Other teams include the those in the Major League Soccer in the U.S, and national teams like U.S.A and Brazil. 

I was not able to get the website to run in i6, but I did get it to run locally. Descriptions of the individual features of CRUD and U.I. of the website and acompanying screenshots of the website can be found in the pdf below :
